# Software Engineering Best Practices for Data Scientists

Data Scientists and those who work in machine learning are often lacking when it comes to applying software engineering best practices when writing code, and it can be a real barrier when writing production-ready code. Therefore, I created this repository to collect a list of best practices I've learned and continue to discover as I write more code. If you feel there are some best practices missing, let me know! The goal here is to have an 80/20 list of best practices for data scientists and ML engineers, not a complete list.

# How To Use Vim

This video by Ben Awad is great. A good way to get better at Vim is to look at how other people use it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiwGbcd8S7I

# Anki Deck

One of the best ways to really learn something is through spaced repetition, so I've created an Anki deck of the best practices. I review parts of the deck about every 2 weeks while I walk on the treadmill at the gym (incline at 5 degrees for improved retention!). I will post the deck here sometime in the coming weeks.
